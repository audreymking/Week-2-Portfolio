# Week-2-Portfolio 

## Bootstrap and CSS

The goal this week was to create functional webpages that can work well on many types of screens.

* Using the Bootsrap CSS framework, I was able to create a mobile responsive porfolio including:

    * A navbar that is consistent on each page with links

    * Personalized information

    * Responsive images and layout
